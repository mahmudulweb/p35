## 📝 Project Overview 
**PlatKelv Concept** is a concept website demonstrating a modern, animated, and responsive layout intended for digital marketing and brand activation campaigns.  
This repo contains static front-end code — HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript — used to create interactive UI elements and micro-animations for a strong visual identity.

## ✨ Design Details
- **Layout:** Responsive grid and hero-first layout with clear CTA sections for Brand Activation and Services.
- **Typography:** Clean, modern fonts (use Google Fonts such as `Poppins`, `Inter`, or `Montserrat`).
- **Colors:** Primary accent + neutral background to emphasize CTAs and visuals.
- **Animations:** Subtle entrance animations, hover interactions, and scroll-triggered reveals.
  - Implemented with CSS transitions/animations and optionally libraries (AOS, Animate.css) or custom JS.
- **Images & Assets:** Use high-quality PNG/SVG for logos and hero illustrations.
