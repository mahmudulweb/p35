**PlatKelv Concept** is a concept website demonstrating a modern, animated, and responsive layout intended for digital marketing and brand activation campaigns.  
This repo contains static front-end code — HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript — used to create interactive UI elements and micro-animations for a strong visual identity.
